ThwargLauncher ToDO - This is a list of priority items to be fixed/added with the Launcher

// - Decal Checkbox on simple mode defaults to checked without being clickable if decal is not detected. Fix default state
 // - Add a message when switching to advanced mode if magfilter.dll is not detected in decal
 // - Do not allow accounts with blanks or special chars in either the account name or password
 // - Move simple launch button from help onto advanced interface
 // - Add space between server name and description string
 - Include server playercount
 - Look into why simple mode decal inject box affects advanced mode.
 - Auto-close clashed clients and relaunch them
 - Auto-launch profile checkbox, to launch selected profile on startup
 - command line arguments to launch queue from command line
 - When launching a client, track it even if it's not set to log into a char
     In MagFilter, heartbeat not started until enter game
	 See LoginCompleteMessageQueueManager.cs(30)
 - UI not updating the display for active account timer
     Server.cs - StatusSummary - SummarizeUptime
	 MainWindow xaml bound directly to StatusSummary
     Existing timer fires GameMonitor.UpdateUiIfNeeded => NotifyGameChange
	   => UiGameMonitorBridge._gameMonitor_GameChangeEvent => UiHandleGameChangeEvent
	   => viewModel.UpdateAccountStatus
	   which calls NotifyAccountSummaryChanged
	   so this should propagate
